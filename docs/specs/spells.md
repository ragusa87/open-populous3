# Spells

`game_core::spell::Spell` -> `cast(&mut Heightmap) -> Option<DirtyRect>` (the terrain part). `GameMap::can_cast`
says whether a spell applies at its target; `GameMap::apply` ignores a cast that does not. Implemented:

| Spell | Effect |
|---|---|
| Land Bridge | line between two cells, heights interpolated, min height 32 |
| Flatten | radius 4 set to center height |
| Erode | radius 4 lowered by 120 (falloff) |
| Raise | editor brush, radius 3 +64 |
| Teleport | sandbox only (not in the original): the caster's living shaman does her cast jump, then is at the target (`Unit::cast_teleport`); only onto ground she can walk (`Mobility::Walk`: no sea, no cliff), checked when cast and again when she lands (she stays if it no longer is); another order during the jump cancels it |

To do: Swamp (surface type), Earthquake (seeded noise along a line - use `map::Lcg`, never `rand`),
Volcano (cone + lava layer), Angel of Death, Firestorm... Mana cost, charges, cast range from shaman.
After every cast: update normals, walkability and destroy buildings on uneven/flooded ground.
Spells must only be cast through `Command::Cast` to stay deterministic.

## Spell book (`game_core::spell_book`)
Per tribe: one `SpellSlot` per `SpellKind` with `Availability` (Hidden / Discoverable / Provided { shots } /
Known / Unlimited: cast at will, used by sandbox spells), `charges` (max 4, fewer for big spells: `max_charges()` from `cost()`) and `recharge` mana.
`tick(mana)` refills recharging spells, `cast(kind)` consumes a charge or a provided shot,
`discover(kind)` turns "?" into Known. Integer only, deterministic. UI: see ui-and-editor.md.
